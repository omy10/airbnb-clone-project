# Team Roles
Our project team is composed of professionals assigned to specific roles to ensure the successful development and deployment of our Airbnb booking platform. Each team member brings unique skills that align with the responsibilities outlined below:

Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the core application logic and server-side functionality. This includes building APIs, handling business logic, ensuring data integrity, and managing user authentication and authorization.

 Frontend Developer
Handles the design and implementation of the user interface. Their role is to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience across all devices. They work closely with the backend team to integrate APIs and display dynamic data.

Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the structure and performance of the database. They are responsible for designing schema models, optimizing queries, maintaining data consistency, and ensuring secure data storage and retrieval.

 DevOps Engineer
Responsible for managing the CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure setup, and deployment environments. They ensure the platform runs smoothly in staging and production, handle scaling, and manage error monitoring and logging systems.

 QA Engineer (Tester)
Ensures the platform is stable, bug-free, and meets user requirements. They write and execute test cases, perform regression testing, and verify both functional and non-functional aspects of the application.

Product Owner / Project Manager
Leads the team by defining the project goals, prioritizing tasks, managing timelines, and ensuring the product meets client expectations. Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team.

 UX/UI Designer
Focuses on user research and experience design. They prototype interfaces and optimize user journeys to ensure intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interaction with the platform.

# Technology Stack
Our Airbnb booking platform is built using a modern and scalable technology stack. Each component plays a key role in delivering a robust and responsive application.

🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django handles our backend logic, RESTful APIs, routing, user authentication, and admin functionalities.

🐘 PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system. It stores user data, booking records, property listings, and handles complex queries with reliability and security.

🔍 GraphQL
An API query language that provides a flexible and efficient way to retrieve and manipulate data. It allows clients to request only the data they need, improving performance and reducing payload sizes.

🖼️ React.js (if you're using it)
A JavaScript library for building fast, dynamic user interfaces. It handles the frontend of our platform, enabling real-time updates and seamless user interaction with the booking system.

🐳 Docker (optional but common in ALX projects)
Used to containerize our application for consistent development and deployment environments. Docker ensures our application runs smoothly across various systems.

☁️ AWS / Heroku (deployment platform)
A cloud service platform used to host and deploy our application, manage scalability, and ensure uptime for users.

🔧 Nginx (optional for production)
A high-performance web server that can act as a reverse proxy for Django and serve static files. It improves speed and security in a production environment.

🔁 Git & GitHub
Version control tools for tracking changes, collaborating as a team, and deploying code from repositories.
